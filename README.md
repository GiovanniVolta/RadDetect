# RadDetect
Advanced Spectroscopy and Emanation Analysis for Radon Content Characterization in Diverse Environments

``raddetect`` is a utility package for Radon content characterization. 

## Installation
`git clone` this repo and:
```
# at top level of raddetect
pip install -e ./ --user
```

Note: you may need to add `--ignore-installed` at the end of `pip install` if it tries to uninstall the old package from a public path (for example, under `/cvmfs/xenon.opensciencegrid.org/releases/nT/2024.02.1/anaconda/envs/XENONnT_2024.02.1/lib/python3.9/site-packages`) which you don't have access to.
